   Demonstration Code for the HEBI motors

   Please read through, fix the motor name, and add to the end.

# on your local the network.

# If you already know the name(s), set to False to skip...

#  Set the Command Lifetime
#
# The HEBI motors have a safety system, where they stop moving if they
# have not received a new command after N milliseconds.  This creates
# a TIME-OUT DURATION.  The default value is 0.25sec.  But as we want
# to update the command once per second, out lifetime needs to be at
# least 1sec!
